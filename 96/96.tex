  \textcolor{red}{D. Berkeley Updike:} In every period there have been better of worse
    types employed in better or worse ways. The better types employed
    in better ways have been used by the educated printer acquainted
    with standards and history, directed by taste and a sense of
    fitness of things, and facing the industrial conditions and the
    needs of his time. Such men have made of printing an art. The
    poorer types and methods have been employed by printers ignorant
    of standards and caring alone for commercial success. To these,
    printing has been simply a trade. The typography of a nation has
    been good or bad, as one or other of these classes had the
    supremacy. And to-day any intelligent printer can educate his
    taste, so to choose types for his work \& so to use them, that he
    will help printing to be an art rather than a
    trade. \textcolor{red}{ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ}
