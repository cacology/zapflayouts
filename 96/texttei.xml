                <p>This transcription focuses on the text as aesthetic
                object, identifying formatting apparently intended by
                Hermann Zapf, retaining hyphenation and line breaks,
                but ignoring the relationship to the entire book. The
                rendering attributes are made without reference to any
                standards and the sizes may not be anywhere near correct.</p>
